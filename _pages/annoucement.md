# **Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) Requirement**

The UK government has introduced the **Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA)** scheme as part of its updated border procedures.  
Depending on your nationality, you **may need to obtain an ETA before travelling to the UK**.

We strongly encourage all international participants to **check their ETA requirements as early as possible**.  
Full details are available on the official UK government website:  
üëâ [Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) ‚Äì gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/electronic-travel-authorisation-eta)

- The **application process is fully online** and typically takes only a few minutes to complete.  
- Most applications are processed **within three working days**, but we recommend applying **well in advance** of your travel date.  
- Airlines may not allow you to board without an ETA.  
- Please ensure you use only the **official gov.uk website** and avoid unofficial sites.

We look forward to welcoming you to Cambridge in September.
